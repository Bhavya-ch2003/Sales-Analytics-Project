# Sales Analytics Project

**Project Title:** Sales Analytics Using Excel, SQL & GenAI

**Objective:** Analyze sales data to identify trends, optimize strategy, and recommend actions to improve business outcomes.

## Contents
- `sales_raw.csv` - Generated raw dataset (contains some simulated dirty rows).
- `sales_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned dataset used for analysis.
- `sales_analysis.xlsx` - Excel workbook with Raw Data, Monthly Summary, Region Summary, Top Products, and Dashboard.
- `sales_queries.sql` - SQL queries to run against the dataset (MySQL/Postgres style).
- `report.pdf` - PDF report summarizing insights and recommendations.
- `README.md` - This file.

## How to use
1. Open `sales_analysis.xlsx` in Excel. Use pivot tables or Power BI to build visual dashboards.
2. Load `sales_cleaned.csv` into your SQL database (table name `sales_data`) and run queries in `sales_queries.sql`.
3. Read `report.pdf` for sample findings and recommendations you can include in your portfolio.

## Notes for GitHub
- Add the CSV and Excel files to your repository.
- Link the `report.pdf` and `README.md` in your repo landing page.
- If you need, replace the synthetic dataset with a public dataset (e.g., Kaggle "Sample - Superstore") — the analysis files will still work.
